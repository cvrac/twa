Tiny Warehouse
Includes the list and the hash table, as well as the file names.

Hash Table
Array of pointers to buckets.
Each bucket, consists of:
-sRec array, which is an array of subsets of records, containing the id of a record, and a pointer to the record with
 this id
-pointer to overflow bucket, if it is needed

Doubly Linked List
Consists of nodes, on which the information for every record is stored

Possible execution:
./twa -l recs150_32.bin -b 2 -f 0.75 -p ops_recs150_20

Possible queries:
t 10 - prints top 10 customers
b 10 - prints bottom 10 customers
q id - prints record with this id
i record - inserts/updates a record(check the record.h for the record structure)
p id - prints the percentile of this customer
a - prints the average amount of all the customers
e - exit
